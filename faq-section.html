          <p>Because they know that if you file bankruptcy, they may get nothing at all. Due to the possibility of taking a loss, creditors are ok restructuring how much you owe, especially once they recognize the financial hardships you are facing. In other words, your creditors would rather accept some v.s nothing at all</p>

          <p>The timeline for reducing your debt can vary depending on the complexity of your situation and how quickly you enroll into the program. You will see a reduction in your monthly payments by up to 60% immediately, which saves most of our customers $100s a month and gives them some breathing room to manage their finances. The full process typically takes 12 to 36 months (compared to 20-30+ years it would take on your own). The program works diligently to negotiate the best terms possible as quickly as they can, so you can start seeing relief sooner.</p>

          <p>Enrolling in a debt relief program may have a temporary impact on your credit score, as you are negotiating with creditors to reduce your debt. However, having large amounts of debt already makes it difficult to get approved for loans or other forms of credit. As your debt is reduced and paid off, your overall financial health improves, which can eventually lead to a better credit score. Many participants find that being debt-free not only relieves stress but also improves their chances of securing loans in the future.</p>

          <p>In most cases, yes, you need to be current on your credit card or loan payments to qualify for the program. Being up-to-date on payments shows creditors that you are committed to managing your debt, which can make negotiations more favorable. However, if you've fallen behind, we can still discuss options that may be available to help you get back on track.</p>

          <p>The program requires you to have at least <strong>$15,000 in unsecured debt</strong> (such as credit card debt, medical bills, or personal loans) to qualify. In fact, the more debt you have, the more the program can save you. Larger debts often mean greater opportunities for negotiation, which can lead to deeper reductions in both your monthly payments and the total amount owed. If you have less than $15,000 in unsecured debt, there are certain circumstances where you can still enroll so we recommend still giving a phone call to see if they can help you.</p>
